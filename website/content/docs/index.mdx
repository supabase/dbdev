## Overview

dbdev is a package manager for Postgres [trusted language extensions](https://github.com/aws/pg_tle) (TLEs). It consists of:

- [database.dev](https://database.dev): our first-party package registry to store and distribute TLEs.
- dbdev CLI: a CLI for publishing TLEs to a registry. This CLI will continue to be available in the short term, but we plan to merge it into the Supabase CLI in the future.
- dbdev client (deprecated): an in-database client for installing TLEs from registries.

<Callout type="warn">
The in-database client is deprecated and will be removed in the future. We recommend using the dbdev CLI's `dbdev add` command to generate the SQL needed to install a TLE, and then including that SQL in your database as a migration file.
</Callout>

If you want to publish your own TLE or install an extension from the registry, you will need the dbdev CLI. Follow its [installation instructions](/docs/cli#installation) to get started.

<Callout type="warn">
Restoring a logical backup of a database with a TLE installed can fail. For this reason, dbdev should only be used with databases with physical backups enabled.
</Callout>
